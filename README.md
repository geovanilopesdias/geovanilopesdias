# Aspiring Software Developer | Physics and Chemistry Teacher

Technologist degree in System Development and Analysis (graduation in february to march/2025). Seeking opportunities in software development, with a focus on Web and Mobile applications. Proficient in Laravel (PHP/MVC/SSR), with amateur experience in Tkinter (Python) and Java Swing.

I began coding in 2020 through online courses, exploring Python, Java, PHP, and HTML/CSS, alongside studying algorithms and software engineering through MIT OpenCourseWare and books like Clean Code by Robert Martin. Solve several small to medium challenges in these languages, as writing tiny games, syntax manipulations and Code Wars challenges - access my Code Wars profile [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/Gheowin). During my degree, I built a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles (e.g., Agile, UML, SOLID). I worked with C, React/JS, Kotlin, and Flutter/Dart to develop small projects. 

The following GitHub stats highlight my coding activity and most-used languages:

## Educational repositories
As a Brazilian Physics and Chemistry teacher, I've been written several scripts for educational purposes or for this context. Below, the main ones are listed.

**1. [GABi](https://github.com/geovanilopesdias/GABi_PTDS)**: accessible [here](https://gabiptds-production.up.railway.app/src/views/pages/login.php), as my capstone project, it's a library management system built from scratch in PHP/PostgreSQL, implementing MVC architecture manually. A demo video will soon be available on YouTube.

**2. [Common Calculators](https://github.com/geovanilopesdias/common_calculators)**: A collection of basic algebra calculators built to practice UI and algorithm implementation in Python (Tkinter) and React (JS).

**3. [PrexGen](https://github.com/geovanilopesdias/urm_exercise_generator)**: it provides ramdomly generated URM exercises (uniform rectilinear motion, but only in Portuguese) as much as one needs; as it's currently written for personal use only, it haven't any UI. It does not use any AI either, so all generations relies on basic algorithms of syntax manipulation. I'm tryng to write it so it could be scale to other subjects and disciplines.

Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out for collaboration!
