# Physicist, Chemist and Junior Developer

I've been Working as Chemistry and Physics teacher since 2011, but since 2020 I've decide to learn how to code as a professional change.

I started to learn coding in 2020, with online courses for Python, mainly [Curso em Vídeo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9uPNppGsGo&list=PLvE-ZAFRgX8hnECDn1v9HNTI71veL3oW0&index=2) and MIT's [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63WbdFxL8giv4yhgdMGaZNA). In 2021, I began to learn Java, aiming to develop for mobile devices with Kotlin; currently I'm learning Java's OOP syntax and particularities before to get into Kotlin and MySQL.

The scripts I already wrote by myself follow below with their abstract and project link.

## Personal projects
As a Brazilian teacher, the scripts written for educational purposes has inputs messages and outputs in Portuguese. Other scripts have (and will have) their I/O written in English, as the Same Weekday Calculator.

**1. [Entropy coins](https://github.com/geovanilopesdias/entropy_coins)**: My first personal challenge. Written for educational purposes, it "flips" a certain number of coins, a certain numbers of times, outputting how many times they all equally fall on.

**2. [Cacheta (Card Game)]()**: My second personal challenge. It runs Cacheta, a Brazilian card game (also known as Pife in the South). I could write methods for (I) generate n decks, (II) shuffle 'em, (III) deal the cards and (IV) detect and organize "trincas" (types of three cards set) as well as the end game.

**3. [URM Exercise Generator](https://github.com/geovanilopesdias/urm_exercise_generator)**: Written for Physics teaching. It generates an inputtable number of URM (aka Uniform Rectlinear Motion) exercises (in Portuguese) creating or editing the result in a .txt file; its later line contains all the answers (with the value and unit require on them). The exercise object, unknown value, data and units are all randomly generated.

**4. [Inorganic Chemistry Exercise Generator](https://github.com/geovanilopesdias/inorganic_exercise_generator)**: Written for Chemistry teaching. It generates an inputtable number of exercises (in Portuguese) creating or editing the result in a .txt file. The types of exercise include (a) Inorganic Nomenclature ("given a specific chemical formula, write its name" or otherwise), (b) Molar Mass calculation ("given a specific chemical formula (or name), figure out its molar mass") and (c) Stoichiometry ("given a balanced chemical reaction and sufficient data, calculate a specific unkown mass"). Any list of exercises will be randomly generated.

**5. [Same Weekday Calculator](https://github.com/geovanilopesdias/same_weekday_calculator)**: Written as a personal challenge as a co-worker request to me. Given the month and year of an event (birthday, etc.) and a limit for calculation, the program outputs all the years when the same event date falls on the same weekday of the event date. It sounds trivial, but I guarantee it doesn't... [Click here](https://github.com/geovanilopesdias/same_weekday_calculator/blob/main/README.md) for further details and let me convince you of. 

## Colaborative projects
I’m currently interested in Python and Java applications as a beginner on those languages, but I'm not engaged (as I  write this, at 7/30/21) in any colaborative project. If you're inclined to invite me, I'd glad to analyze your offer: just let me know.

## Further projects and learning
Aiming to develop Android apps, as I mentioned, I intend to learn Kotlin and MySQL as soon as I code some functional Windows applications with Java, which I'll post here as they're finished.
